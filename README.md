# SQL-KA-Projects
These are projects I made with SQL while going through Khan Academy's Intro to SQL.




Data Dig:
Using the Top 100 Movies Dataset, and use advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data. 
What sort of questions might one have about that data, like if they were using it for an app or a business idea?

Famous People:
In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, 
then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.

App Impersonator:
Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.
