# SQL-KA-Projects
These are some of the projects that I made with SQL while going through Khan Academy's Intro to SQL course.

[Data Dig](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/more-advanced-sql-queries/pp/project-data-dig):
Used the [Top 100 Movies Dataset](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/c705b02114ea3db0dff0), and SELECT queries to discover statistical information regarding the profits of the bestselling movies.

[Famous People](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/relational-queries-in-sql/pp/project-famous-people):
Made a table with some small set of famous musicians along with their Spotify Statistics and generated data about their overlapping musical  
information.

[App Impersonator](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/modifying-databases-with-sql/pp/project-app-impersonator):
Made a mock-table for user-data stored by the mobile app Cytus and generated statistics about user data.
